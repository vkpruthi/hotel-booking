# Hotel Booking System Performance Characteristics

## Concurrency Handling

### Request Throttling
- **Maximum Concurrent Requests**: 1000 requests (configured via Semaphore)
- **Request Timeout**: 2 seconds for permit acquisition
- **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Fair semaphore implementation ensuring FIFO request processing

### Thread Pool Configuration
- Managed by Java's built-in `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Default configuration from `HttpServer`
- Thread lifecycle follows standard JVM thread management

## Performance Metrics

### Request Handling Capacity
- **Maximum Throughput**: ~1000 concurrent requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Requests exceeding the concurrent limit receive 429 (Too Many Requests) response
- **Request Timeout**: 2 seconds before rejecting excess requests

### Connection Management
- Uses `HttpServer` default connection backlog
- Efficient request body handling using byte array buffering
- Synchronized response handling to prevent race conditions

## Implementation Approach

### Request Processing
1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Fair semaphore with 1000 permits
   - 2-second timeout for permit acquisition
   - Graceful rejection with 429 status code

2. **Response Management**
   - Synchronized response writing
   - Proper header handling
   - Graceful handling of edge cases (empty responses, already sent headers)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- Proper resource cleanup
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Automatic permit release in all scenarios

## Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Booking creation requests
- Booking update requests
- Booking cancellation requests
- User booking retrieval requests
- Individual booking retrieval requests

### Error Tracking
- IO Errors
- Invalid request formats
- Rate limiting rejections
- Stream handling issues

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment
1. Monitor the rate limiter behavior
2. Adjust concurrent request limit based on:
   - Server hardware capacity
   - Database connection pool size
   - Actual usage patterns

### Performance Tuning
1. Consider adjusting:
   - Semaphore permit count (currently 1000)
   - Permit acquisition timeout (currently 2 seconds)
   - Thread pool size if needed

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling possible
- Consider implementing circuit breakers for better load handling
- Monitor database connection pool usage

## Load Testing Results

The system has been tested under load with concurrent requests and shows stable performance with:
- Successful handling of up to 1000 concurrent requests
- Proper request queuing and processing
- Effective error handling under high load
- Stable response times within acceptable ranges

*Note: These performance characteristics are based on initial testing and may need adjustment based on specific deployment environments and requirements.*
